h1. Clear-Cache

h2. What is this?

Clear-Cache is a Google Chrome extension that gives you instant access to clearing your browser data with a single click.

h2. Why is it not available on the Chrome Web Store yet?

Since clearing the browser cache is still an experimental feature at the moment and the Web Store doesn't allow any extensions using these features to be submitted, Clear-Cache has to be installed manually.

h2. When will it be available in the Chrome Web Store?

Luckily, the Chrome engineers are busy at work on the extensions API and supposedly the Chrome dev channel will soon receive the non-experimental API.
